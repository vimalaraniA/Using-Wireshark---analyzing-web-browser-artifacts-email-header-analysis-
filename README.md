## AIM:
To use Wireshark to analyze web browser activities and inspect email headers from captured network traffic.

## DESIGN STEPS:
### Step 1:
Launch Wireshark and start capturing traffic on the appropriate network interface.

### Step 2:
Use filters like http, dns, or tcp.port == 80 to monitor web browser artifacts such as visited URLs, cookies, and user-agent strings.

### Step 3:
Apply filters like smtp, pop, or imap to locate and analyze email header details (e.g., sender, receiver, subject) from email communications.

## PROGRAM:
Wireshark Web and Email Traffic Filtering Steps

## OUTPUT:
*A. Capturing Traffic in Wireshark*

1. Open Wireshark and start capturing on the active interface (Wi-
Fi/Ethernet).

2. Perform activities like opening a website or sending an email through a
client (e.g., Gmail via browser or Thunderbird).
3. Stop the capture once done.

*Email Header Analysis*

1. Apply relevant filters:
2. 
o For POP3: tcp.port == 110

o For SMTP: tcp.port == 25 or 587

o For IMAP: tcp.port == 143 or 993

4. Locate email data:
5. 
o Look for SMTP packets to see sender/receiver email addresses.

o Use "Follow TCP Stream" to view the full email headers and body if unencrypted.

*Extract Email Header Fields:*

o Analyze From, To, Subject, Date, Message-ID, and relay servers used in sending the email.
